## Features

- üåü **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.
- üïπÔ∏è **Interactive Animation**: Smooth hover effects, processing animation, and a confirmation checkmark.
- üíª **Customizable**: Easy to modify colors, fonts, and styles via CSS.
- üì± **Mobile-Friendly**: Adjusts for smaller devices with optimized font sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the content.
- **CSS3** for styling and animations.
- **JavaScript** for managing button states (processing and payment confirmation).
- **Remixicon** for the payment card icon.

## How it Works

- When the user clicks the button, it enters a "processing" state with a loading animation.
- After a short delay (simulated by JavaScript), the button changes to a "paid" state, displaying a checkmark to indicate successful payment.
